# Project Description
<!---
Include the project description from the assignment,
your chosen target platform,
programming language,
and a name for the software.
--->
This project is about creating a system for doctors to keep track of patients in a hospital environment. In order to do this, the system lets the doctors know important details about the patients, such as their treatments, allergies, diagnosis and corresponding doctor, which is accessible through the system. This system is implemented as a web application using Node.js with Javascript and is called Horror Hospital.
The following tools have been decided on: Slack is used as the main communication tool. As suggested we are also using Travis as a build and testing tool and GitHub as project repository and issue tracker. MariaDB is the database management system, and  Node.js as an open source server framework and Angular as front-end web application platform.

# Sprint 1 Log
<!---
Per sprint, fill out one sprint log section and its subsections.
--->
This is the first spint of the project and contains the setup of the project.

## Commitment
<!---
List the features/stories that the team committed to finish during the sprint.
--->
The following features were commited to for the first sprint:
- Set up Slack.
- Set up Github.
- Create a "Hello World" application.
- Set up a working back end.
- Configure Travis-CI.

## Work Done
<!---
Log what was accomplished, and how.
Please report on all activities; for example, in addition to coding, planning and design discussion.

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member

*Name and ID of each feature* | *X hours* | *Member A: Y hours, Member B: Z hours*

## Reflections
<!---
Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep within 1000-1500 words. Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment. Reflect on the agile practice practiced:
- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?
    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.
- How did the practices interact?
  Did they complement or counteract each other?
- How efficient were the practices, given the time they took to use?
---->
The work went very well on the first meeting and all team members participated equally in the important discussions that we had. Since we decided to use Angular, Node.js and Travis, which were new for many of us, we decided that we could watch tutorials about these tools and frameworks so that we could be prepared for the actual starting of the programming. Also, we discussed and explained briefly about these tools and frameworks during the meeting since some of us had used them before. Except the different dicsussions we had, we also  helped each other when a teammate had some problem with his or her work, for example when setting up Travis and so on. 

Since we have had only one meeting where we got started with the project by setting up the environment and getting to know each other, we have not practiced any proper agile pracices yet. Despite this, the first meeting has been important anyways since we also recieved information from the supervisors about how the project will work. 

# Sprint X Log
*As for the previous sprints.*


# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.
The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.

Considering the following:

- With regards to the agile practices, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?


# Project outcome
Document the project, for example using screenshots.
