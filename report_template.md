# Project Description
<!---
Include the project description from the assignment,
your chosen target platform,
programming language,
and a name for the software.
--->
This project is about creating a system for doctors to keep track of patients in a hospital environment. In order to do this, the system lets the doctors to know important details about the patients, such as their treatments, allergies, diagnosis and corresponding doctor and so on, which can easily be put into the system for later access. This patient tracking system is implemented as a web application using Node.js with Javascript and is called XXX.

# Sprint 1 Log
<!---
Per sprint, fill out one sprint log section and its subsections.
--->
This is the first spint of the project and contains the setup of the project.

## Commitment
<!---
List the features/stories that the team committed to finish during the sprint.
--->
During the first sprint, we introduced and let us know each other by talking about our background and skills. Later on, we set up Slack as a communication tool, Travis as a build and testing tool and GitHub as project repository and issue tracker, but also concluded that we will use MariaDB as the database management system, Node.js as an open source server framework and Angular as front-end web application platform. Other than that, we also got started with the project by creating a "Hello World" application as a first step, with the help of a necessary backend and frontend setup. Before we did this, we went through the different possible features together that we thought are necessary in our system and filled them in our backlog on the GitHub's issue tracker, which can be seen in more detail in the link above.

## Work Done
<!---
Log what was accomplished, and how.
Please report on all activities; for example, in addition to coding, planning and design discussion.

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member

*Name and ID of each feature* | *X hours* | *Member A: Y hours, Member B: Z hours*

## Reflections
<!---
Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep within 1000-1500 words. Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment. Reflect on the agile practice practiced:
- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?
    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.
- How did the practices interact?
  Did they complement or counteract each other?
- How efficient were the practices, given the time they took to use?

# Sprint X Log
*As for the previous sprints.*


# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.
The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.

Considering the following:

- With regards to the agile practices, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?


# Project outcome
Document the project, for example using screenshots.
